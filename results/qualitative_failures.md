# Qualitative failure cases (auto-sampled from eval detail)

These examples come from the title→passage evaluation detail dump.
They illustrate limits of nearest-neighbor retrieval over ISOT — not claim verdicts.

Retrieved opposite-bucket neighbors show topical/style overlap across source classes. They do **not** prove or refute the query claim.

## Same-subject / outlet-style collapse

- **Query:** 'Puerto Rico needs restructuring to avoid cascading defaults: Treasury' (subject `politicsNews`) → 3 other same-subject articles in top-5.
- **Query:** 'Hillary Responds To Bernie Calling Her Unqualified, And It’s Kinda Perfect' (subject `News`) → 2 other same-subject articles in top-5.
- **Query:** 'China lodges protest after Trump call with Taiwan president' (subject `politicsNews`) → 2 other same-subject articles in top-5.
- **Query:** 'Internet Collectively Cringes After Photographer Snaps Pic Of Trump’s Nutsack' (subject `News`) → 2 other same-subject articles in top-5.

- **Query:** 'RAND PAUL: SOMEBODY WAS SPYING On Trump Campaign…It’s “already been proven to be true” [VIDEO]' (subject `politics`) → 2 other same-subject articles in top-5.

Same-subject neighbors often share wire diction or political framing; the ranker can collapse to outlet/topic style rather than the specific claim.

## Takeaway

High self-retrieval scores mean the index can find an article's own passages from its title. That is necessary but not sufficient for fact-checking. ISOT labels remain source buckets.
